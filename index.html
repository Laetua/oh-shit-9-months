      But you ain't ‚ùå.
    </p>

    <p>
      After being with you for a whole of 274 days, 22 hours, and 6 minutes, I can't believe that I am still with you üò≤
      Today is the day where I review you again and check if you are eligible for renewal or not.

      Based on the above assessments and after carefully analyzing you over the past 9 months, I have taken my decision.
      The question is whether you are going to be passed for renewal. If yes, what are the benefits you'll receive and
      what are the guidelines you must follow ‚Äî all will be mentioned herewith.
    </p>

    <p>
      First of all, I would like to give you some appreciation for successfully lasting for 9 months in my life.
      After all, it's me ‚Äî so you must find yourself to be a very lucky man to have survived this far and enjoyed all its benefits.
    </p>

    <p>
      The question today is whether we will be moving forward with you.
      Usually, I close my business after 9 months, as 9 months has been my highest personal record.
      But it seems like you have exceptionally outdone yourself and have been very consistent with your efforts from the beginning.
    </p>

    <p>
      I observed that you have bravely taken great risks by moving states and living under indescribable conditions for the sake of our overall wellbeing.
      A selfless quality in you has come to my notice. I was informed by my spies that you have selflessly sacrificed your daily comfort and simple pleasures for us.
    </p>

    <p>
      You have outshined yourself at every opportunity that came your way ‚Äî be it 6 am in the morning or long hours of waiting in the metro alone.
      You also made frequent visits to ensure smooth operation.
    </p>
